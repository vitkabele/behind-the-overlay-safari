#  Behind The Overlay (Safari version)

Hide the annoying overlays on various websites.

## Disclaimer

This application is inspired by the [NicolaeNMV/BehindTheOverlay](https://github.com/NicolaeNMV/BehindTheOverlay) browser extension for Firefox and Chrome.
I just ported the code to the Safari WebExtension and created icons to make it look nice (sigh, but I did my best!) on macOS.
